The topic of our project consideres the ratings given to players in Madden NFL 21 as well as other information from players. There is a wide variety of options on what we can do with our data set for the project.

Some ideas for questions that we can explore would be who is the fastest running back in Madden 21, which college has produced the most current NFL players, Which college has produced the highest average rating of players in the NFL, which team has the lowest salary compared to overall rating and so on. 

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The data set that we chose is from the video game Madden NFL 21. The game is created and developed by the company electronic arts and is based on off the national football league. The data set contains every player in the 2020-2021 season and apply them with mental and physical attributes to grade players on their football abilities. Furthermore, it also includes other information like salary and which college they attended. The data was made by professional football analyst who work for electronic arts. They use their professional judgment as well as statistics from previous seasons to grade each player on the specific attributes and score them to reflects to their real-life abilities. Furthermore, player ratings are updated throughout the week during the season. Being that judgment is used by the makers of the data set, it could imply a limitation. The purpose of the data set is to recreate the real-life players in the video game with the same qualities that they how shown in real-life.

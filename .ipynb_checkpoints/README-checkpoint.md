## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

With this dataset we hope to be able to analyse which teams will fair best throughout the season and to calculate the "math" behind fantasy football. We would like to create a hypothesis on which teams get to the superbowl. In addition to this we would like to accrue a selection of teams with outside the normal structure when it comes to the skills of their individual players.


## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

We chose a data set created by Daniel Fernandez on Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/dtrade84/madden-21-player-ratings/metadata. This is data is accumulated from the statistics created by ea games for the released Madden 21 game. The basis for the data set can be found at https://www.ea.com/games/madden-nfl/madden-nfl-21/player-ratings?isLocalized=true. 

The data within is a curated list of ratings for different attributes within the game, as well as a few pieces of their identity. These are meant to be updated throughout the season and will aim to reflect how the real players compete in the real world. The data was first created before the launch of the NFL season on September 10 2020, right through until February 7 2021. We will be using the first set of data otherwise known as "Launch Rating". 

The purpose of this dataset is to be a bit of fun and to inform players of Madden 21.
